@Autowired
- it is used for automatic dependency injection.

- DI is a design pattern that removes dependency from programming code so loosely coupled.
- so easy for managing and testing.

- autowiring enables to inject the object dependency implicitly
-- internally uses setter injection,
                   constructor injection,
                   field injection

- autowiring of primitive or string values not possible. only of references done.

@Qualifier("")

used along with autowired for cases if we have more than one bean of the same type and want to specify one of them to be wired.
-- name of bean in such annotations is always with first letter **lowercase**.
--written at place of class where injection is done

@Primary
-- used to give higher preference to a bean where ambiguity of multiple beans of same type. removes confusion of the IoC container
-- written over the bean definition and not in the usage place
