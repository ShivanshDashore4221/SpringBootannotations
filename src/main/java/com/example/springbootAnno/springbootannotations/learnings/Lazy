@Lazy

It is used to indicate that a bean should be lazily initialized.
-- very effective for optimizing resource usage by delaying creation of a bean until it is required

Normal init : Spring initializes all beans eagerly when application context is being created. (eager init)
Lazy init : defers initialization until demanded

-- depends on specific use cases not useful all time.

Purpose of LAZY :
1. deferred initialization
2. improve startup performance of spring boot application
3. optimize in cases of beans with resource intensive operation
4. Helps in resolving Circular Dependencies
and breaks the circular reference cycle.
