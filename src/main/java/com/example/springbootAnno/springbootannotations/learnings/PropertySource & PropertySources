@PropertySource --> used to provide access to custom properties file to Spring Environment

@PropertySources --> used to provide access to multiple properties files to spring environment.
 We by default have the "application.properties" file to be used by the Spring Container.
 But, To have other custom properties files and provide its access to Spring IoC Container, we need to use @PropertySource
 BOTH USED WITH @Configuration based Classes.

 @PropertySource annotation is repeatable.
 We use @value and Environment class to read the property file.

 We made a different class as with @Configuration. So when we run SpringBootApplication, the beans are made first and this configuration bean serves as config providing access to the custom properties files.
--@Configuration
--@PropertySource("classpath:db.properties")
--@PropertySource("classpath:mail.properties")
--public class DemoConfig {
--}

Also, The @PropertySource is repeatable.

Now using @PropertySources for multiple @PropertySource, we give an array (PropertySource[]) as argument in annotation.
--@PropertySources({
--        @PropertySource("classpath:db.properties"),
--        @PropertySource("classpath:mail.properties")
--})
